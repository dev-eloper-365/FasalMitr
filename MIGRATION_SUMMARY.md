```

## How to Deploy on Another PC

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
1. Copy the entire `agriculture_consolidated` folder to the new PC
2. Run `scripts\setup.bat` to install all dependencies
3. Run `scripts\start_all.bat` to start all services

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Copy the entire `agriculture_consolidated` folder to the new PC
2. Install Python 3.8+ and Node.js 16+
3. Follow the detailed instructions in `README.md`

## File Size Optimization

The migration has been optimized to reduce file size by:
- Excluding unnecessary virtual environment files
- Consolidating duplicate dependencies
- Organizing files efficiently
- Creating automated setup scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Test the migration**: Run `scripts\verify_structure.bat` to ensure everything is in place
2. **Deploy**: Use the setup scripts to deploy on the target PC
3. **Customize**: Modify configuration files as needed for the new environment

## Support

All original functionality has been preserved. The consolidated structure makes it much easier to:
- Deploy on new systems
- Maintain and update
- Share with team members
- Scale the application

Your FasalMitraAI Agriculture Management System is now ready for migration! 🚀
